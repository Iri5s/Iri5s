Hello!

My name is Jaiden, IT nerd by day, programming nerd by night, definitely not as cool as Batman though. Experienced in Windows and Linux system administration, PowerShell, C#, PHP, Go, JS and even Visual Basic. Mainly focused on system administration tools and web projects but enjoy any challenge that presents itself.

My most notable projects include:
- <a href="https://zerrix.com/zerrix-console-for-workspace">Zerrix Console</a> - A Google Workspace tool for IT admins that allows for efficient, secure and centralized domain management.
- Being apart of the <a href="https://www.beyondatc.net/">BeyondATC</a> team, a leading ATC simulation program for Microsoft Flight Simulator. 
- A plugin-free flight tracking tool for X-Plane and MSFS.
- A modern and concise helpdesk system built using PHP and Fomantic-UI.

Most code is private, however if you do find some old code, don't judge me too much!

Have a good one!
Jaiden (Iri5s)
