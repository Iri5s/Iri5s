Hello,

I'm Iris, my dayjob is in a medium sized Windows IT education, doing everything from systems administration, to hardware and networking. I fell in love with coding in this role, I started really getting into coding in 2020, first starting scripting in Powershell and Visual Basic and then moving on to my primary language C#, over the years I've developed various tools in both .NET Framework and .NET Core, with Windows Forms Apps as well Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF). I've built a handlefull of websites and API's of various complexity using primarly PHP in these projects, with a JS or JQuery front end, depending on complexicty. I often use Microsoft SQL Server and MySQL for DB storage.

My most notable projects include:

- A plugin-free flight tracking software for use with a Virtal Airline for X-Plane and MSFS.
- A Google workspace administration GUI. 
- A helpdesk built with PHP and Fomantic-UI.
- A small networking application to identify the port number of a IOT device on a switch from an IP address.   

I'm always looking for different technologies to explore and learn about, new and old code is on this Github, although most is private if you notice something I could improve on, I always appreciate constructive feedback. 

Have a good one!
Iris.
