Hello,

I'm Iris, I am here to expand my knowledge and build programs and scripts around C#, Visual Basic and Powershell. I also dabble in web development, using C#, PHP, JS, JQuery, React. I work in a Windows 10 IT education environment so making things that make my life easier is my goal.

I always appreciate constructive feedback. 

Have a good one!
Iris.
