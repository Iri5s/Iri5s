Hello,

My name is Jaiden, my day job consists of working in IT for a medium-sized Windows based education institution, doing everything from systems administration to hardware and networking. I fell in love with coding in this role. I started getting into coding in 2020, first scripting in Powershell and Visual Basic before moving on to my most used language nowadays, C#, over the years I've developed various tools in both .NET Framework and .NET Core, with Windows Forms Apps as well Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF). I've built various websites and APIs of differing complexity using primarily PHP with a JS or JQuery front end (depending on the project). I often use Microsoft SQL or MySQL for DB storage.

My most notable projects include:
- A Google Workspace administration tool. 
- A plugin-free flight tracking software for use with a Virtual Airline for X-Plane 11/12 and MSFS.
- A modern and simple helpdesk system built with PHP and Fomantic-UI.
- A small networking application to resolve the port number, on a swtich, of an IOT device from its IP address.   

I'm always looking for different technologies to explore and learn about, new and old code is on this Github, although most is private if you notice something I could improve on, I always appreciate constructive feedback. 

Have a good one!
Jaiden (Iri5s)
