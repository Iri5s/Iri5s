Hello!

My name is Jaiden, IT nerd by day, programmer by night. Experienced in Windows and Linux system administration. Full stack experience across languages such as C#, PHP, Go, JS. Scripting with PowerShell and Visual Basic. Always looking for any challenge that presents itself.

Some of my most notable projects include:
- Being a part of the <a href="https://www.beyondatc.net/">BeyondATC</a> team, a leading ATC simulation program for Microsoft Flight Simulator.
- A Google Workspace tool for IT admins that allows for efficient, secure and centralized Google Workspace management.
- A plugin-free flight tracking tool for X-Plane and MSFS.
- A modern and intuitive helpdesk system built using PHP and Fomantic-UI.

Most code is private.

Have a good one!
Jaiden (Iri5s)
